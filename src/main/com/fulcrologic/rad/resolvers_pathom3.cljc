  "Support for allowing Pathom 3 resolvers to be declared on attributes via ::pco/input ::pco/output and ::pco/resolve.
  This is useful because it allows custom resolution of an attribute that then has all of the RAD abilities that attributes have.

  Further, all keys in `::pco/*` participates in the generation of the resolvers. The full Pathom3 `defresolver` API is available.

  fulcro-rad has no explicit dependency on pathom3, and should not have.
  It is assumed that you have it on your classpath if you require this ns.

  ```
  (defattr server-time :server/time :inst
    {::pco/output [:server/time]
     ::pco/resolver (fn [_ _] (java.util.Date.))
     ::form/label \"Current Server Time\"
     ::form/field-style :some-custom-style
     ...})
  ```

  To register the resolvers in your index:

  ```
  (let [all-attribute-resolvers (resolvers/generate-resolvers all-attributes)
        base-env (pci/register all-attribute-resolvers)]
    ... now wrap base-env, see at least com.fulcrologic.rad.attributes/wrap-env)
  ```

  You may also, of course, define resolvers using `pco/defresolver` and other pathom3 functions, but you must register those
  separately. `pci/register` takes multiple args."
